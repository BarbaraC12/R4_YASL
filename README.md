## Yasl Description

YASL is a interpreted language based on a multiple‐reversed‐stack paradigm.  
It has first been design for high‐level accounting and financial operations by  
non‐IT‐specialist users.

## Yasl History

YASL stands for Yasl is an Accounting Stack Language. It was first design by DEC for  
South Africa accounting managers using OSF/1 (DEC Unix OS for workstations). A  
specific standard library was provided to handle local rates and taxes systems. This  
one was probably lost in 1998 when Compaq aquired DEC. Nowadays, its use is pretty  
much limited, due to lack of powerfull framework. YASL is reported still being used in  
Malaisia and Singapore. The YASL name have been also reused for an open‐source  
project, a Java framework over Swing.
